## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the RoadCraft Save Editor** (either the executable or from source)
2. **Open your save file**:
   - Click the "Open Save File" button
   - Navigate to your RoadCraft save file location:
     - `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Saber\RoadCraftGame\storage\steam\user\[SteamID]\Main\save\SLOT_[number]\CompleteSave`
3. **Make your desired changes** to vehicles, resources, or player stats
4. **Save your changes** by clicking the "Save" button

## 🌍 Creating Your Own Language File

1. Go to the `Lang` folder next to the executable
2. Copy `en.json` and rename it, e.g. `de.json`
3. Edit `lang_name` / `native_name` (this is how it appears in the language list)
4. Translate the `strings` section
5. Start the editor — your new language now appears in **Settings → Language**

`Lang` files are automatically created next to the executable on first run.

## ⚠️ Usage Notes

- While automatic backups are created, manual backups are still recommended.
- Use at your own risk – modifying game files may affect gameplay or stability.
